        The really great thing about having two TV shows going on at the same time is that I can go to one and say that I have to go and visit the other, and then I can just go home, and they don't know.

          Ten is too small a number to list all the great television of 2017.
        </section>
        <br /><br />
        <section>
          That may be what makes it the correct number. If I went longer — 20 shows, 25, even more — I’d seem to be simply listing everything I liked watching that year. (And I’d still be leaving out dozens of shows.) At ten, I’m making cuts that hurt.
          <br />
          Those cuts included, but were not nearly limited to: “Better Call Saul,” “BoJack Horseman,” “The Carmichael Show,” “Catastrophe,” the final season of “Girls,” “Insecure,” “Legion,” “Master of None” and “Mindhunter” — and that’s just A through M.
          <br />
          “The Americans,” one of TV’s best dramas, aired what felt more like the first half of a double final season. “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “I Love Dick” and others had inconsistent seasons but transcendent episodes. Maybe I should have included “The Vietnam War,” but for simple apples-to-apples manageability I stuck to scripted TV.
          <br />
          (I also stuck to my practice of not ranking my list, because beyond a few definite favorites — “The Leftovers,” especially — I’d probably list these in a different order any given day you asked me.)
          <br />
          I could go on, but I have limited room. The good news is — as this list and its omissions prove — TV does not.
